# Blockchain vs DLT
___
- DLT is a decentralized database managed by multiple participants, across multiple nodes.
- **Blockchain is a variant of DLT** that uses *cryptographic and algorithmic approaches* to create and verify a continuously expanding, append-only data structure that gradually turns into a chain of transaction blocks that serve the role of a ledger.

In a blockchain, transactions are recorded with an immutable cryptographic signature called a hash. The transactions are then grouped in blocks and each new block includes a hash of the previous one, chaining them together, hence why distributed ledgers are often called blockchains.
