### Solution to the Problem
- A public key certificate can be thought of as the digital equivalent of a passport. 
- It is issued by a trusted organization and provides identification for the bearer. A trusted organization that issues public key certificates is known as a Certificate Authority (CA). 
	- The CA can be likened to a notary public. 
- To obtain a certificate from a CA, one must provide proof of identity. Once the CA is confident that the applicant represents the organization it says it represents, the CA signs the certificate attesting to the validity of the information contained within the certificate.
