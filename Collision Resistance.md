# Collision Resistance
___

it is **infeasible** to find two values, x and y
such that `H(x)=H(y)`

- collision‐resistant if nobody can find a collision
- we said nobody can find a collision, but we did not say that no collisions exist

- there are **NO** hash functions **proven** to be collision‐resistant. The cryptographic hash functions that we rely on in practice are just functions for which people have tried really, really hard to find collisions and haven’t yet succeeded
